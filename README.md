BaseDice
========

Dynamic narrative crossing sports (baseball) and gambling (craps).

Note
----

I can't take credit for the idea, but I don't know _who_ to credit.  I recently stumbled across a file on an old hard drive outlining the rules without any indication of where they came from or what to do with them.

I _do_ know two important things:

 - I never entered into any kind of business deal to bring this to market.

 - Rules of games can only be protected through patents, and there is no patent covering these rules.

In other words, I believe this is a safe project to publish, legally speaking.

It would still be nice to give whoever came up with the concept credit, though.

Usage
-----

 1. Build.

 2. Run.

 3. Play.

The "game" engine runs for 27 outs (no inning structure, for the moment), reporting what has happened and a final score.

I should point out that I don't follow baseball and don't gamble, so if any part of this looks peculiar--as if I don't know what the output should look like--it's because I'm just implementing the idea directly.

Build
-----

It definitely works in MonoDevelop. It almost certainly works in SharpDevelop. It probably works in Visual Studio, maybe with some fudging.

Obviously, that needs testing.
